The Gospel of John is an abstract of the entire Bible. Whereas the Gospel of John is an abstract of the Bible, the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings is an extract of this Gospel. Because the Bible is so long, we need an abstract of it in order to see a sketch of the whole. Then we need an extract of this abstract to see its essence. In these messages our concern is with the extract of each chapter.

As we have previously pointed out, an extract may be understood as a liquid extracted from a plant or other organic matter and that contains its essence in concentrated form. A synonym for extract is “spirit,” which is the essence of a substance extracted in liquid form. Wine, for example, may be regarded as an extract, or spirit, of grapes. Whenever you extract the essence of a particular substance, you get the spirit of that substance. The extracts of certain substances are sometimes used as medicine. We may say that the twenty-one chapters of the Gospel of John are a certain substance, and in these messages we are concerned with the extract of this substance. Likewise, this extract may cheer us, or, like medicine, it may heal us.

We have pointed out that the content and reality of the universe is God’s people as His dwelling place. The universe may be compared to a shell, and God’s people as His dwelling place, to the content of this shell. Today God is building His people together to become His dwelling place. This dwelling place is the tabernacle. According to the picture in the Old Testament, God’s serving ones, the priests, dwelt in the tabernacle; that is, they dwelt in God’s dwelling place. Hence, the tabernacle is a mutual dwelling place, a dwelling place for both God and man. This dwelling place is the center and reality of the universe and also the center and reality of the Bible.
